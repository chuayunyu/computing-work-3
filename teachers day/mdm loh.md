mdm loh
she is our hero!
she teaches us science and tells us stories about the world
chemistry in the lab and chemistry of love
she always goes the extra mile to help anyone
the experiments in the lab are always fun
microscopes, osmosis, paper chromatography
she makes every lesson interesting with a bright smile
and she helped my grades go up
her criticism is fair and constructive
she never leaves struggling ones behind
she inspires everyone to do their best
and encourages us with donuts
she is a star!
but not just any star, **our** star!
